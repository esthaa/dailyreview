            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
            <p>My birthday is April 28, I was born in Fresno CA in the childrens hospital, 
            my hobbies are watching/doing makeup and sports, both of these hobbies
            interest me the most. When I am older and have the money, I would love to travel to 
            Dubai because from the pictures online I can tell that it is a beautiful place to explore and 
            a place to learn new things about.</p>
